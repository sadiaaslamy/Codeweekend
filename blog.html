                    WEB WIDE WORLD: World Wide Web or www is basically a huge distributed application running on millions of servers worldwide, it is accessed using a special program called web browser.
                    Let’s see how the web works with an example.
                    -If you want to visit a website like Codeweekend.net, you open up your browser and type Codeweekend.net you will end up to its website. So what is happening behind the scene?
                    You are a client and you are requesting a website form a server.
                    First we have to know concept of Client and Server, Computers connected to the web are called Client and server, Client can be your mobile phone, your computer or any other devices connected to network and web-accessing software available on those devices like Chrome, Brave …
                    Servers are computers that store webpages, when a client’s device wants to access a webpage, a copy of the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user’s web browser.
                    When you enter URL (www.codeweekend.net) you send this to the internet that is called the request.  What you are getting back is a response, that is all the data package you receive. 
                    Your machine is making a request to a server and it’s getting responses back, the server is just another  machine on the internet. 
                    The Codeweekend website is stored on a server and when the browser sent your request, it acts as an interpreter; it sent your request on the internet to the server with the help of ISP, ISP means Internet service provider. ISP is a way that you are connected to the internet. It gets back certain source code from server and displays  that on your screen in a readable form. So how the servers know that we meant the server by entering Codeweekend.com?
                    The server is a machine, whenever a machine connected to the internet, it gets what it called an IP address or in another words the official address of each server is an IP address for example: 172.105.106.99
                    IP( Internet Protocol)  is a series of numbers that identifies any device on a network usually it has four portion. 
                    Each server has its unique IP address, through IP addresses we can access a server, but mostly we access it through its Domain name.
                    There is another type of server called DNS means Domain name system. The main job of DNS is to translate domains to IP addresses
                    So now a question may arise, if you know the exact IP address of a website why would we need to use its Domain name?
                    You can enter the IP address of Codeweekend.net to your browser in order to access it, but the domain name is much more human readable and therefor the actual first thing that happens when you enter this, is that your browser contacts a DNS domain name system server which is basically a huge collection of name along with their domain names, where each domain name is mapped to an IP and then they offered this DNS server translate your Codeweekend.net domain into an IP address.
                    This IP address is then given to the browser and with that the browser can actually make that request to the server, the server receives the request, analyzes and send appropriate HTML/CSS back to browser .  browser receive the shared HTML/CSS and just resend it. 
                    What we see on a browser is the result of a combination of HTML, CSS, JavaScript. These are the languages involved in getting onto the screen what we see now.
                    Web browser is a software which can transfer text within in a special format (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) into meaningful user interface where end users can see or interact.
                    HTML (Hypertext markup language) gives a website its structure and browser is able to read that because it’s a standardized format.
                    CSS(Cascading Style Sheets) defines the appearance and style of the website 
                    JavaScript is responsible for all the logic and dynamic things that happen in the browser
                    For creating a web page we need two things on our machines
                    1.Plain text editor -> for writing the code
                    2. Web browser -> for testing and seeing the result.<br>
