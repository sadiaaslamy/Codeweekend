                   HELLO AND WELCOME!
                   This is Sadia Aslamy from Afghanistan. My journey in tech has been started when I joined Kardan University on March 2020, but due to covid-19 pandamic all of our courses
                   were online.I studied there one and half year, due to Afghanistan's situation I couldn't continue my studies there and moved to another country. Currently 
                   I am living in Germany. As a studnet I am learning Deutsch language and web developing.
                   My goal in 5 years is to be a developer who works with Afghans. Besides owning my small business. I hope I will be able to provide oppertunity for others
                   especially(girls) to work and be independent even if they are at early ages.

                   Happy to be a part of this community.
                   I am looking forward to expending my skills and experinces.
                 </P>
